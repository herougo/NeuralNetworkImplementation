## Neural Network Implementation

**MyNeuralNetwork.py** is my implementation of the neural network and backpropogation. It uses the sigmoid activation function, fully connected layers, and the cross-entropy cost function.

**CopiedFromOtherSources** is a folder containing neural network implementations from other sources. I used them to understand the calculations behind backpropogation.
